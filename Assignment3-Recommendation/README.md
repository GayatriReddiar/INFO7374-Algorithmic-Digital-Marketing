## Introduction
Recommender systems are utilized in a variety of areas and are most commonly recognized as playlist generators for video and music services like Netflix, YouTube and Spotify, product recommenders for services such as Amazon, or content recommenders for social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter. These systems can operate using a single input, like music, or multiple inputs within and across platforms like news, books, and search queries.
We will be using below two recommendation models-
1. **Restricted Boltzmann Machine:** A Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) is a generative neural network model typically used to perform unsupervised learning. The main task of an RBM is to learn the joint probability distribution 
ùëÉ(ùë£,‚Ñé) where ùë£ are the visible units and ‚Ñé the hidden ones.
2. **Simple Algorithm for Recommendation:** SAR is a fast, scalable, adaptive algorithm for personalized recommendations based on user transaction history. It is powered by understanding the similarity between items, and recommending similar items to those a user has an existing affinity for.

## Dataset
We have created a Snack dataset using Faker which is a Python package that generates fake data. 
The dataset consists of the following columns : 
1. userId: unique identifier of the user
2. Product_Id: unique identifier of the product
3. Ratings: rating provided by the user
4. timestamp: time of rating
We also have a product dataset containing the snack name :
1. Product_Id: unique identifier of the product
2. Snack_name: product name
3: Category: category of product
